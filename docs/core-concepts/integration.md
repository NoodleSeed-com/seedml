# Integration

SeedML simplifies external service integration through intent-focused patterns that handle authentication, data flow, and error cases automatically.

## Core Concepts

```yaml
app MyApp {
  # Declare integration needs
  integrate {
    auth: oauth2        # Authentication pattern
    storage: cloud      # File handling
    email: transact     # Communication
    payment: stripe     # Processing
  }

  # Intent-focused usage
  entity Order {
    on create {
      notify: email     # Automatic handling
      track: analytics  # Built-in integration
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Smart Authentication
```yaml
auth {
  # Complete auth patterns
  type: oauth
  providers: [google, github]
  features: [mfa, sso]     # Security included
}
```

### 2. Data Integration
```yaml
storage {
  # Automatic data handling
  files: s3          # Cloud storage
  cache: redis       # Performance
  search: elastic    # Advanced features
}
```

### 3. Service Communication
```yaml
services {
  # Intent-based integration
  weather: {
    provider: openweather
    cache: 30min          # Smart caching
    retry: automatic      # Error handling
  }
}
```
