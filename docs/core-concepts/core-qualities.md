# Core Qualities

SeedML is built on eight fundamental qualities that make it uniquely suited for modern application development:

## 1. LLM-Native Design

**What It Means**
- Designed to be generated and modified by AI language models
- Consistent patterns that map to natural language
- Minimal but unambiguous syntax
- Context-preserving structure

## 2. Single Source of Truth

**What It Means**
- One file describes the entire application
- All aspects (data, UI, logic, integrations) in one place
- No redundant specifications
- No sync issues between layers
