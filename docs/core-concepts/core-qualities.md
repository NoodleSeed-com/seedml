# Core Qualities

SeedML is built on four fundamental qualities that make it uniquely suited for AI-native development:

## 1. AI-First Design

```yaml
# Clear patterns that map to natural language
entity Order {
  # AI understands these concepts naturally
  status: enum(draft, submitted, approved)
  total: money
  customer: reference
  
  # Intent is clear to both AI and humans
  validate: {
    total: positive
    customer: verified
  }
}
```

**Key Aspects:**
- Designed for AI generation and modification
- Natural language mapping
- Context-preserving structure
- Minimal but unambiguous syntax

## 2. Intent Over Implementation

```yaml
# Express what you want, not how to build it
screen Orders {
  # High-level patterns imply implementation
  list: [date, customer, total, status]
  actions: [create, approve]
  features: [search, filter, export]
}
```

**Key Aspects:**
- Focus on business goals
- Hide technical complexity
- Smart pattern recognition
- Progressive disclosure

## 3. Single Source of Truth

```yaml
# One file describes everything
app OrderSystem {
  # All aspects in one place
  data: {
    entities: [Order, Customer]
    storage: cloud
  }
  
  ui: {
    screens: [dashboard, orders]
    theme: modern
  }
  
  rules: {
    workflow: [approve, fulfill]
    security: role_based
  }
}
```

**Key Aspects:**
- Complete system specification
- No redundancy
- Automatic consistency
- Clear dependencies

## 4. Smart Defaults

```yaml
# Best practices built-in
entity User {
  # These imply proper handling
  email: email        # Validation included
  password: secure    # Hashing automatic
  role: admin        # Permissions set
  
  # Override only when needed
  name: string {
    min: 2,
    max: 50
  }
}
```

**Key Aspects:**
- Production patterns included
- Override when needed
- Progressive complexity
- Secure by default

## Why These Matter

1. **Faster Development**
   - AI generates more accurately
   - Less boilerplate
   - Fewer decisions needed

2. **Better Quality**
   - Consistent patterns
   - Built-in best practices
   - Reduced errors

3. **Future Ready**
   - AI-native architecture
   - Technology independent
   - Easy to evolve
# Core Qualities

SeedML ensures essential software qualities through intent-focused patterns that automatically implement best practices.

## Core Concepts

```yaml
app QualityApp {
  # Declare quality needs
  qualities {
    performance: high      # Speed focus
    reliability: 99.9%     # Uptime target
    maintainable: true     # Code quality
    testable: complete     # Coverage
  }

  # Quality-focused features
  api Orders {
    cache: smart          # Performance
    retry: automatic      # Reliability
    docs: generated       # Maintainability
    tests: integration    # Quality
  }
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Performance
```yaml
performance {
  # Automatic optimization
  cache: {
    strategy: smart      # Caching
    invalidate: auto     # Freshness
  }
  
  optimize: {
    queries: true       # Database
    assets: true        # Frontend
    api: true          # Backend
  }
}
```

### 2. Reliability
```yaml
reliability {
  # Built-in stability
  errors: {
    handling: complete    # Error management
    recovery: automatic   # Self-healing
    reporting: detailed   # Monitoring
  }
  
  testing: {
    unit: required       # Code quality
    integration: auto    # System health
    performance: load    # Capacity
  }
}
```

### 3. Maintainability
```yaml
maintainable {
  # Code quality focus
  structure: {
    modular: true        # Organization
    documented: auto     # Understanding
    consistent: true     # Standards
  }
  
  practices: {
    clean: true         # Code quality
    tested: true        # Verification
    reviewed: true      # Quality control
  }
}
```

### 4. Testability
```yaml
testing {
  # Comprehensive testing
  coverage: {
    unit: 80%           # Code tests
    integration: 90%    # System tests
    e2e: critical       # User flows
  }
  
  automation: {
    ci: full            # Integration
    deployment: safe    # Release
    monitoring: live    # Production
  }
}
```
