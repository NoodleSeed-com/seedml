- No redundant specifications
- No sync issues between layers

**Why It Matters**
- Eliminates inconsistencies
- Simplifies maintenance
- Speeds up development
- Reduces errors

## 3. Semantic Over Syntactic

**What It Means**
- Focus on meaning over mechanics
- Business concepts map directly to code
- Intent-based configuration
- Domain-driven patterns

- Easier validation
- Reduced translation errors

## 7. Full Stack Coherence

**What It Means**
- All layers work together
- Consistent patterns throughout
- Automatic relationship handling
- Built-in integrations

**Why It Matters**
- Reduced complexity
- Better maintainability
- Fewer bugs
- Faster development

## 8. Implementation Determinism

**What It Means**

- Better security
- Simpler debugging
# Core Qualities

SeedML ensures essential software qualities through intent-focused patterns that automatically implement best practices.

## Core Concepts

```yaml
app QualityApp {
  # Declare quality needs
  qualities {
    performance: high      # Speed focus
    reliability: 99.9%     # Uptime target
    maintainable: true     # Code quality
    testable: complete     # Coverage
  }

  # Quality-focused features
  api Orders {
    cache: smart          # Performance
    retry: automatic      # Reliability
    docs: generated       # Maintainability
    tests: integration    # Quality
  }
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Performance
```yaml
performance {
  # Automatic optimization
  cache: {
    strategy: smart      # Caching
    invalidate: auto     # Freshness
  }
  
  optimize: {
    queries: true       # Database
    assets: true        # Frontend
    api: true          # Backend
  }
}
```

### 2. Reliability
```yaml
reliability {
  # Built-in stability
  errors: {
    handling: complete    # Error management
    recovery: automatic   # Self-healing
    reporting: detailed   # Monitoring
  }
  
  testing: {
    unit: required       # Code quality
    integration: auto    # System health
    performance: load    # Capacity
  }
}
```

### 3. Maintainability
```yaml
maintainable {
  # Code quality focus
  structure: {
    modular: true        # Organization
    documented: auto     # Understanding
    consistent: true     # Standards
  }
  
  practices: {
    clean: true         # Code quality
    tested: true        # Verification
    reviewed: true      # Quality control
  }
}
```

### 4. Testability
```yaml
testing {
  # Comprehensive testing
  coverage: {
    unit: 80%           # Code tests
    integration: 90%    # System tests
    e2e: critical       # User flows
  }
  
  automation: {
    ci: full            # Integration
    deployment: safe    # Release
    monitoring: live    # Production
  }
}
```
