# Introduction to SeedML

## Why SeedML?

Modern software development faces several key challenges:
- Business requirements get lost in translation across multiple technical layers
- Changes require updates across numerous disconnected components
- Different teams (business, frontend, backend) speak different languages
- Development requires constant context switching between technologies

SeedML solves these challenges by providing:
- A single source of truth for entire applications
- Natural language-like syntax that maps directly to implementation
- AI-native design that works seamlessly with LLMs
- Technology-independent specifications that can target any modern stack
