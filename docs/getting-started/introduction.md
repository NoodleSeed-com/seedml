# Introduction to SeedSpec

## Why SeedSpec?

Modern software development faces several key challenges:
- Business requirements get lost in translation across multiple technical layers
- Changes require updates across numerous disconnected components
- Different teams (business, frontend, backend) speak different languages
- Development requires constant context switching between technologies
- Type safety and validation often come too late in the development process

SeedSpec solves these challenges by providing:
- A single source of truth for entire applications
- Strong type system with compile-time validation
- Clear module boundaries and explicit contracts
- Natural language-like syntax that maps directly to implementation
- AI-native design that works seamlessly with LLMs
- Technology-independent specifications that can target any modern stack

## Key Features

### 1. Type Safety First
```seed
// Types are explicit and validated at compile time
entity User {
  name: string {
    min: 2
    max: 50
  }
  email: string {
    format: email
    unique: true
  }
}
```

### 2. Clear Module System
```seed
// Explicit imports and exports
import "@stdlib/core"
use { Button, Card } from "@stdlib/components"

export {
  UserProfile,
  UserSettings
} from "./components"
```

### 3. Component Schemas
```seed
// Define reusable contracts
schema Button {
  required {
    text: string
    onClick: function
  }
  optional {
    disabled: boolean
    variant: enum {
      values: ["primary", "secondary"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Design System Integration
```seed
// Type-safe themes and styling
theme MainTheme {
  tokens {
    colors {
      primary: color(#0066cc)
      secondary: color(blue.500)
    }
    spacing {
      small: size(4px)
      medium: size(8px)
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Early Error Detection**
   - Type errors caught at compile time
   - Clear validation messages
   - No runtime type surprises

2. **Improved Maintainability**
   - Clear module boundaries
   - Explicit dependencies
   - Self-documenting code

3. **Better Collaboration**
   - Shared language between teams
   - Clear contracts and interfaces
   - Consistent patterns

4. **Faster Development**
   - Less boilerplate
   - Automated validation
   - Code generation
   - IDE support

## Getting Started

1. **Install SeedSpec**
   ```bash
   npm install -g seedspec
   ```

2. **Create a New Project**
   ```bash
   seedspec init my-app
   cd my-app
   ```

3. **Start Coding**
   ```seed
   // app.seed
   app MyApp {
     // Your app specification here
   }
   ```

4. **Generate Code**
   ```bash
   seedspec generate
   ```
