> üöß **Early Development**: SeedML is currently in initial development. We're sharing our vision and progress openly, but the implementation is not yet ready for use. Star the repo to follow our progress!

## Vision

SeedML is an LLM-native specification language for describing complete applications in a single, consistent format. It serves as an intermediate representation between natural language requirements and implemented applications.

### The Problem We're Solving

Current software development requires translating business requirements through multiple layers and technologies:
- Business requirements ‚Üí Technical specifications
- Technical specifications ‚Üí Multiple implementations
- Changes need updates across all layers
- Different teams speak different languages

### Our Solution

A single, consistent language that can describe entire applications and be generated by LLMs:

```yaml
# Example of our target syntax
app TaskManager {
  entity Task {
    title: string
    status: todo->doing->done
    assigned: User?
    priority: low/medium/high
  }

  screen TaskBoard {
    layout: kanban(status)
    card: [title, assigned.avatar, priority]
    actions: [assign, move, edit]
  }

  rules {
    assign: {
      when: assigned changed
      do: notify@assigned
    }
  }
}
```

This specification will generate a complete, working application.

## Current Status

- [x] Initial language specification
- [x] Basic syntax documentation
- [ ] Parser implementation
- [ ] Basic compiler
- [ ] Development tools
- [ ] Example applications

## Planned Features

- **Complete Application Specification**: Define everything from data models to UI in one place
- **LLM-Native Design**: Optimized for AI generation and modification
- **Technology Agnostic**: Compile to any modern tech stack
- **Production Ready**: Built-in best practices and security patterns
- **Full Stack**: Covers database, backend, frontend, and integrations

## Examples

Here's a progression of examples showing the expressiveness and simplicity of SeedML.

### Basic CRUD Application

```yaml
# Simple customer management system
app CustomerManager {
  entity Customer {
    # Basic information
    name: string
    email: email
    phone: phone?
    status: active/inactive = active
    
    # Validation rules built-in
    validate: email != null if status == active
  }

  # Generates complete admin interface
  screen Customers {
    list: [name, email, status]
    search: [name, email]
    actions: [create, edit, delete]
  }
}
```

### Business Application with Logic

```yaml
# Order management with business rules
app OrderSystem {
  entity Order {
    # Basic fields with types
    customer: Customer
    items: [
      product: Product,
      quantity: int > 0,
      price: money
    ]
    
    # Computed fields
    subtotal: sum(items.price * items.quantity)
    tax: subtotal * 0.2
    total: subtotal + tax
    
    # State management
    status: draft->submitted->approved->shipped->delivered
    
    # Business rules
    rules {
      submit: {
        require: [
          items.length > 0,
          customer.verified,
          total <= customer.creditLimit
        ]
        then: notify@sales
      }
      
      approve: {
        require: role.manager
        check: items.all(inStock)
        then: [create@invoice, notify@warehouse]
      }
    }
  }

  # UI with business-oriented layout
  screen Orders {
    list {
      view: table
      show: [id, customer, total, status]
      group: status
      actions: [
        submit if draft,
        approve if submitted and role.manager
      ]
    }
    
    detail {
      layout: split
      left {
        customer: card
        items: editable-table
      }
      right {
        summary: [subtotal, tax, total]
        status: timeline
        actions: panel
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Analytics Dashboard

```yaml
# Real-time analytics dashboard
app Analytics {
  # Data models
  entity Metric {
    name: string
    value: number
    timestamp: datetime
    category: string
  }

  # Dashboard screen
  screen Dashboard {
    layout: grid(2x2)
    
    # Multiple chart types
    widgets: [
      {
        type: line-chart
        data: Metric
        x: timestamp
        y: value
        group: category
        range: last-7-days
      },
      {
        type: counter
        data: Metric
        value: sum(value)
        change: vs_previous_period
      },
      {
        type: bar-chart
        data: Metric
        x: category
        y: sum(value)
      },
      {
        type: table
        data: Metric
        columns: [name, value, timestamp]
        sort: -timestamp
        limit: 10
      }
    ]
    
    # Interactive features
    features: [
      time-range-selector,
      category-filter,

  # External API definition
  api OpenWeather {
    base: "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5"
    key: ${WEATHER_API_KEY}
    
    endpoints {
      current: {
        path: "/weather"
        params: [city: string, units: string]
        cache: 30min
      }
      
      forecast: {
        path: "/forecast"
        params: [city: string, days: int]
        cache: 1h
      }
    }
  }

  # Data models
  entity Location {
    city: string
    country: string
    coords: [lat: float, lon: float]
  }

  # UI components
  screen Weather {
    params: [location: Location]
    
    layout: cards
    
    widgets: [
      {
        type: weather-card
        data: OpenWeather.current(location.city)
        show: [temp, humidity, wind]
      },
      {
        type: forecast-chart
        data: OpenWeather.forecast(location.city)
        range: 5d
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

These examples demonstrate:
1. Progressive complexity
2. Business logic integration
3. UI/UX patterns
4. External service integration
5. Data modeling
6. Access control
